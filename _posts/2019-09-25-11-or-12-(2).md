The following problem originates from one of my earlier post [11-or-12](https://yuanhang0.github.io/posts/11-or-12).

Suppose A and B play a game of fair dice. A keeps throwing the fair die until he obtains the sequence "11" in two successive
throws. B throws the die until he obtains the sequence "12" in two successive throws.

We've found their expected waiting times. Now let's try to derive the exact distribution of their waiting times.

Let $X=[\text{ total number of trials until the first "11" }]$. To obtain the distribution of $X$, we make use of the transition matrix. Let $\pi = (p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)$.

To be finished.

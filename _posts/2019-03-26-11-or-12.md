I first encountered this problem in the final of my probability class.
Later, similar questions appeared here and there so I decided to write this solution.
The method involved is known as "first-step analysis", which is very useful in stochastic processes.

A and B play a game of fair dice. A keeps throwing the fair die until he obtains the sequence "11" in two successive
throws. B throws the die until he obtains the sequence "12" in two successive throws.
Are their expected waiting times the same? Compute their expected waiting times.

<p>
Let $E_0=[\text{ expectation to get '11' if last roll is not 1 }]$ and $E_1=[\text{ expectation to get '11' if last roll is 1 }]$. Then we have the following recursive relationship:
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
E_0 = \frac{1}{6}(E_1+1)+\frac{5}{6}(E_0+1) \\
E_1 = \frac{5}{6}(E_0+1)+\frac{1}{6},
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
which gives
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
E_0 =42\\
E_1 =36.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Here $E_0 = 42$ is the average waiting time to obtain the sequence '11'.

Similarly, let $E'_0=[\text{ expectation to get '12' if last roll is not 1 }]$ and $E'_1=[\text{ expectation to get '12' if last roll is 1 }]$. Then we have the following recursive relationship:
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
E'_0 = \frac{1}{6}E'_1+\frac{5}{6}E'_0+1\\
E'_1 = \frac{1}{6}E'_1 + \frac{4}{6}E'_0+1
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
which gives
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
E'_0 =36\\
E'_1 =30,
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Here $E'_0 = 36$ is the average waiting time to obtain the sequence '12'.

We see that, in average, we should expect to see the sequence '12' sooner compared to '11'.

A similar but simpler problem: find the expected number of coin tosses until first two consecutive heads, i.e., 'HH'.
You can try to solve it by the method above.
